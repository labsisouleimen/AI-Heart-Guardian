## 🧠 The AI Pipeline (Built from Scratch)
Unlike many generic solutions, this project covers the full Machine Learning lifecycle:

1. **Dataset Curation:** I designed and pre-processed the ECG dataset, implementing signal filtering and noise reduction to ensure data quality.
2. **Model Architecture:** A custom-built **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** optimized for temporal signal patterns.
3. **Training:** Leveraged TensorFlow/Keras to train the model, achieving high sensitivity to cardiac arrhythmias.
4. **Desktop Integration:** Wrapped the model into a professional GUI for non-technical workplace users.
